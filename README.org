* float-narrow-indirect

A GNU Emacs package that provides floating window support for narrow-indirect operations. This package allows you to create floating windows containing narrowed regions of buffers, making it easier to view and compare different parts of a file.

- Create floating windows for narrowed regions
- Aggregate multiple regions in a single floating frame
- Easy navigation between main and floating windows
- Customizable window appearance and behavior
- No mode-line in floating windows for cleaner view
- Automatic window balancing when adding new regions

** Installation

*** Manual Installation

2. Add the following to your Emacs configuration:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/float-narrow-indirect")
(require 'float-narrow-indirect)
#+END_SRC

** Usage

1. Select a region in any buffer
2. =M-x ni-narrow-to-region-floating= to create a floating window with the selected region
3. Use =M-x ni-toggle-focus= to switch between main and floating windows
4. Use =M-x ni-clear-aggregation= to close all floating windows
