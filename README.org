* float-narrow-indirect

A GNU Emacs package that provides floating window support for narrow-indirect operations. This package allows you to create floating windows containing narrowed regions of buffers, making it easier to view and compare different parts of a file.

** Features

When working with multiple parts of a file in Emacs, traditional split-window layouts can make your screen cluttered. float-narrow-indirect offers an elegant solution - it allows you to "extract" selected text regions into independent floating windows.

- üéØ Focus: Float important code snippets in separate windows to reduce visual distractions
- üîÑ Flexible: Open multiple floating windows simultaneously for easy content comparison
- üé® Clean: Floating windows without mode-line for a cleaner reading experience
- ‚ö° Quick: One-key focus toggle between main and floating windows
- üéõÔ∏è Customizable: Adjust window size, transparency, border color and more to your preference

** Common Use Cases

- Keep important paragraphs in floating windows for quick reference while reading long documents
- View multiple related function implementations simultaneously during code refactoring
- Compare differences between old and new versions while writing documentation
- Keep critical code segments in view while debugging

** Installation

*** Manual Installation

1. Download =float-narrow-indirect.el= to your local machine
2. Add the following to your Emacs configuration:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/float-narrow-indirect")
(require 'float-narrow-indirect)
#+END_SRC

** Usage

1. Select a region in any buffer
2. =M-x fni-narrow-to-region-floating= to create a floating window with the selected region
3. Use =M-x fni-toggle-focus= to switch between main and floating windows
4. Use =M-x fni-clear-aggregation= to close all floating windows

*** Recommended Key Bindings

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c n f") 'fni-narrow-to-region-floating)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c n t") 'fni-toggle-focus)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c n c") 'fni-clear-aggregation)
#+END_SRC

** Customization

You can customize the following variables:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
;; Size of floating windows (width . height) as ratio of parent frame
(setq ni-floating-window-size '(0.3 . 0.5))

;; Border color for floating frames
(setq ni-floating-frame-border-color "gray50")

;; Transparency for floating frames (active . inactive)
(setq ni-floating-frame-transparency '(95 . 90))

;; Buffer name prefix and separator
(setq ni-buf-name-prefix "NI-")
(setq ni-buf-name-separator "::")
#+END_SRC
